                        In spite of over 100 years of technical education in the country, there still exists a lack of expertise and quality research opportunities for students. Consequently a large number of students are compelled to explore shores beyond their own country for higher education. Having perceived a deficiency such as this, IIT Jodhpur has created the Centres of Excellence (CoE) in some of the high potential areas. These centres will cater to the growing needs and potentials of the students involved in higher education by providing them tools, methodologies and support for exciting research opportunities. The institute currently has three CoE’s in Energy, ICT and Systems Science.</font>

                        The Centre of Excellence in energy is indirectly aimed at developing sustainable infrastructure by providing solutions to acute problems in energy security. Jodhpur, the sun-city, being a perfect location for harnessing the renewable forms of energy, is an asset for exploiting these renewable sources to generate power for urban and rural infrastructure. The vision of this CoE aims at developing a 200 acre solar power park, integrating it with local communities using micro and DC smart grids, renewable energy driven main campus and setting up an international centre for solar energy technology.

                        Sustainable infrastructure development is essential for the economic growth and well-being of a country. Energy security is at the core of this effort. IIT Jodhpur intends providing solutions to the acute problems that humankind is facing due to the gradual depletion of the earth's finite energy resources which are largely non-renewable (fossil fuels). Deploying renewable energy technologies is at the heart of this endeavour as they have a much lower environmental impact than the conventional energy technologies. Harnessing solar energy to generate power is one of the primary objectives of this CoE. IIT Jodhpur has earmarked a 200 acre land on its permanent campus for creating a solar park, comprising all the existing technologies under one roof. The power generated from such solar plants can be used with in the local communities employing micro and DC smart grids. IIT Jodhpur nurtures an ambition to build its main campus driven by renewable energy sources, thereby contributing to the global cause of minimizing global warming, CO2 emission and ecology imbalance. An international centre for solar energy technologies will be set up on the IIT Jodhpur campus for man power development and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.

                        A system can be considered as a collection of entities and their interrelationships gathered together to form a whole greater than the sum of the entities. The interactions are represented by simple rules that describe how the state of an entity in the system is dependent on the state of its neighbours.
                        As per the historical notion, Mathematics has been playing a key role in realizing, describing and dealing with systems in almost every area of science and engineering. The need of new mathematical tools and techniques in systems science is a challenging task. Further, due to the emergence of systems movement in some areas of engineering and management, for example, designing engineering systems of rapidly increasing complexity and decision making in complex organizations, it becomes more important to think in terms of systems. Systems engineering and systems analysis become integral in determining the evolution of systems movement, and Mathematics plays an important role in critically analyzing and understanding the same.

              <p class="card-text">Following are a few of the major concerns that drive the systems science research at CoE in SS:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Societal concerns have led to regulatory actions that reflect more stringent requirements for the safety and reliability of products; they demand new methods for forecasting and quantification of uncertainties</li>
                        <li>Engineering systems and manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly complex, and cost effectiveness of these needs to be addressed.</li>
                        <li>The useful integration of large data requires that it be processed, preferably in real time, and transformed into information and knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Natural Sciences present a lot of interesting and complex systems. Rigorous mathematical frameworks that give a deeper insight need to be conceived. Such frameworks enable the design of new materials and processes with prescribed functional properties.</li>
                        <li>Globalization, awareness of resource limitations, increasing sensitivity to anthropogenic effects on the environment force the CoE in SSM to continually analyse and evaluate its activities in a broader social context, beyond the bottom line.</li>Globalization, awareness of resource limitations, increasing sensitivity to anthropogenic effects on the environment force the CoE in SSM to continually analyse and evaluate its activities in a broader social context, beyond the bottom line.

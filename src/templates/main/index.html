                            years I spent at IIT Jodhpur. The campus provided great environment for studies and
                            research, accompanied by highly experienced faculty members who ensured that students have
                            in-depth knowledge of the subject. This learner centric environment motivated us to pursue
                            our dreams freely and got us up to date with industry standards. The Placement Cell here is
                            extremely hard working and assisted students in developing professionalism and proper work
                            ethics. The OSP provided various opportunities to choose our future domain from. I am proud
                            to be part of such an Institution and I am thankful to IIT Jodhpur for making us who we

                            academic, professional or personal growth. Speaking about the placements, I got the
                            internship at Morgan Stanley on the very first day of the session. I was a part of the OSP
                            team and have personally experienced the kind of hard work that the team put in to ensure
                            that all the students get the best. I got a PPO from Morgan Stanley so did not sit for the
                            placement session. But, kudos to the entire team that we got the best stats for the CSE so
                            far. I wish the whole team best of luck for the coming sessions.</p>

                            memorable experience. It taught me all the necessary skills and provided opportunities to
                            not only build a successful career but also to progress well ahead in life. An important
                            part of it was due to the efforts of the Office of Student Placements, who worked selflessly
                            and efficiently to provide awesome work opportunities to the students.

                            I got selected for a two-month summer internship at D.E. Shaw India Private Limited during
                            my third year. The placements team had ensured that the whole process was smooth for the
                            candidates and the interviewers. I finally got a pre-placement offer from the company after
                            the internship and I finally joined it after my graduation.

                            A big thanks to the Office of Student Placements for their tireless efforts and I hope it
                            gets even better over the years to come.</p>

                            interest. Being a part of institute's first batch of Industry Immersion Program (IIP), I got
                            the opportunity to spend my 3 summers at Tata Power. and learn about the functioning of
                            Industry. It was an enriching experience as I could apply the acquired practical knowledge
                            in class and improve my understanding of the subject. OSP plays a pivotal role in helping
                            students getting placed in a suitable company and making the placement process hassle free

                    <ol>
                      <li> If a student registers to interview with a company, it is mandatory for the student to
                           participate in the entire process of placement (starting from online test, presentation by the
                           company to the interview). If a student does not follow the same he/she shall be debarred
                           from the upcoming three companies of his/her respective branch.</li>
                      <li> It is suggested for a student to accept an offer made by a company. A student, who is
                           offered a job by a company, is out of the placement process irrespective of whether the
                           student accepts the offer or not. However, under special circumstances OSP may allow
                           students placed in a company to apply for placement process in a later company.</li>
                      <li> In case a student has received a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO), he/she must accept or reject
                           the offer before appearing for the next round of the Interview. Once the student accepts
                           the PPO, he/she is immediately out of the placement process. Only when the student
                           rejects the PPO, then he/she can participate further in the placements.</li>
                      <li> If a Student has multiple job offers on a single day, he/she should select one and inform
                           the same to OSP within the minimum time period specified by the OSP.</li>
                      <li> Only the batch of students graduating in summer 2020 are allowed in the 2019-20
                           placement process.></li>
                      <li> After first round of registration in July’19, a second round of registration may be conducted
                           in due course of time. After second registration, first registration shall be considered as
                           cancelled.</li>

                    <ol>
                    <li> It is suggested for a Student to accept an internship offer made by a company. A Student, who is offered an internship by a company, is out of the internship process irrespective of whether the Student accepts the internship or not.</li>
                    <li> As an Intern in a company, a Student is expected to create a positive image about
                         himself/herself and the Institute. Any negative feedback received from the company
                         during a student’s internship period will be considered seriously and the student can
                         be debarred from the Placements.</li>
                    <li> Declining internship offers secured through OSP is not normally allowed. If a student
                        does not join the offered internship without having a genuine reason and company
                        informs the OSP about the same, then OSP can take appropriate disciplinary action
                        against the student including but not limited to debarring the student for few days
                        from the campus placement session.</li>
                    <li>If a company gives a range of internship stipend (and benefits) in their document and
                        at the time of the selection by the company the stipend or benefits are less than what
                        were announced, the student may reject the offer or accept the offer and it is entirely
                        up to the student (students are requested to inform OSP about this anomaly
                        immediately).</li>
                    <li>OSP strongly discourages students going for off-campus internship in the companies
                        that OSP is in talk with for campus selection for internships as this affects the
                        Company-Institute relationship. Students are requested to forward any contacts that
                        they may have in various companies so that OSP can invite the companies formally
                        to the Institute.</li>
                    <li>Students registered for on-campus internship is not allowed to appear simultaneously
                        for off-campus internship. OSP will immediately deregister such students and may
                        debar from the upcoming campus placement session. Students may appear for off-
                        campus internship only after informing OSP and completion of due deregistration
                        process.</li>

                    <ol>
                    <li> Students are expected to maintain integrity during online tests/interviews. Any student
                        found cheating or involved in any other unfair means by any OSP member during the
                        test/interview will be debarred from the placement process.</li>
                    <li> It is mandatory for a Student to follow the dress code laid down by OSP.</li>
                    <li> OSP only assists students in the placement process, and does not take responsibility of
                         placing students.</li>
                    <li>Absenteeism from the selection process after registering for the same may invite strict
                        disciplinary action, in addition to debarring of the student from further participation in the
                        selection process. Attendance is counted ONLY when the student is physically present.</li>
                    <li>A student is not allowed to meet or contact the members of the visiting team without the
                        prior permission of the OSP staff members, even if the student has been shortlisted by the
                        company. No Student should contact any official of a company registered with OSP.</li>
                    <li>A Student should not provide any wrong information to OSP. Also, students are advised
                        only to treat any official communication by OSP via mail, website or portal as correct.</li>
                    <li>All applications to the companies are to be made through OSP ONLY. If a student does
                        not apply through OSP for a particular company, he/she will not be allowed to participate
                        in the selection process of that company.</li>
                    <li>All students are advised to check the company profile and background thoroughly before
                        applying. OSP will NOT and shall not be liable for any default at/on the company’s end at
                        any stage later.</li>
                    <li>If the students face any behavioural issues/problems from the recruiter’s side, they should
                        inform such issues/problems to OSP immediately. Students shall NOT take action at their
                        end.</li>
                    <li>Students appearing for any tests/GD/presentation should report before the start of
                        process. Any entry post the scheduled time may not be allowed and the students would be
                        considered absent for that particular process. Any violation or forced entry after that time
                        limit would be considered as misconduct and will be dealt with as such.</li>
                    <li>No cell phones are allowed in a test. The process holds the same sanctity as any of the
                        minor/major exams and the students may be debarred if found in violation as also leading
                        to disciplinary proceedings.</li>
                    <li>Impersonation in tests/selection process or any kind of malpractice is a serious offence.
                        Seating in tests will be pre-defined by Placement &amp; Training cell/ company representatives
                        and any violation will be considered as misconduct and the student is liable to be
                        deregistered immediately and referred to the concerned authorities for disciplinary action.</li>
                    <li>Students must carry their Institute ID-cards at all times during the placement process. No
                        one would be allowed to enter the test/interview venue without the institute ID-card.</li>
                    <li>The date/ time/ venue of the interviews may change which, at times, may be at a short
                        notice. Students must keep themselves well informed in this regard.</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate behaviour is unacceptable by a Student during placement or internship
                        process, which may hamper the Company-Institute relationship and/or institute
                        policies/decorum.</li>
